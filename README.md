Customise this as you wish! Works on all iOS versions as long as you have certificate fixing for older versions.
## How do iPhone Web Applications work?
They are made with html. You need an icon and a splash screen, and also need to add this code to your html head:
```
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes" />
<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black" />
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="icon.png" />
<link rel="apple-touch-startup-image" href="splash.png" />
```
Icons need to be 57x57 for older iOS versions.
## How do i save this to my homescreen?
Press the share button at the bottom of the screen, then press "Add to Home Screen". Feel free to try without an internet connection, and delete once you are done.
